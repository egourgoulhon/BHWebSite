    <p> These pages accompany
    <a href="https://luth.obspm.fr/~luthier/gourgoulhon/en/" target="_blank">Éric Gourgoulhon</a>'s lectures
    in the framework of the
    <a href="https://psl.eu/en/education/psls-graduate-programs">PSL Graduate Programs</a> in
    <a href="https://psl.eu/en/graduate-programs/graduate-program-physics">Physics</a>
    and in
    <a href="https://psl.eu/en/graduate-programs/graduate-programs-astrophysics">Astrophysics</a>, jointly organized
    by the Doctoral Schools <a href="https://www.edpif.org/en/">Physique en Île-de-France (ED 564)</a> and <a href="https://ecole-doctorale.obspm.fr/">Astronomie et Astrophysique d'Île-de-France (ED 127)</a>,
    from 10 May to 20 June 2023.
    </p>

    <p>These lectures are devoted to various aspects of black hole physics, which are relevant both
for contemporary astrophysics and for fundamental physics. The prerequisite is having
followed an introductory course of general relativity, typically at the level of a master's degree.
Doctorate students should register <a href="https://www.edpif.org/fr/formation/scientifique.php#102">here</a>.
    </p>

    <h3>Schedule</h3>

    <p>The lectures are taking place in room CONF IV = E244 (*) of the <a href="https://www.phys.ens.fr">ENS Physics Department</a>, 24 rue Lhomond, 75005 Paris.
    </p>

    <p>
Lectures 1 and 2 set the theoretical framework and discuss the basic properties of black holes. In
particular, the concept of Killing horizon (Lecture 2) is central in the theory of stationary black
holes. Lectures 3 and 4 are quite relevant for astrophysics, since, by virtue of the no-hair theorem,
all isolated and stationary black holes in the Universe are expected to be Kerr black holes.
Notably Lecture 4 is devoted to the interpretation of the images of M87* and Sgr A* recently
obtained by the Event Horizon Telescope. On the other side, Lectures 5 to 7 are more theoretically
oriented. In particular, black hole thermodynamics is pivotal in the current approaches to
quantum gravity.
Keeping in mind applications to theoretical physics, the spacetime dimension <em>n</em> is kept general,
except in Lectures 3 and 4, where <em>n=4</em> is assumed. Similarly, it will be made clear whether a given
result is valid only in general relativity (i.e. relies on the Einstein equation) or remains true in
modified theories of gravity.
